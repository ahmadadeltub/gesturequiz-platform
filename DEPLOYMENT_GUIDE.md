# 🚀 Deploy GestureQuiz to GitHub Pages - Step by Step Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Make sure you have a GitHub account
2. **Git Installed**: Install Git on your computer
3. **Repository Access**: You'll need to create a new repository or use an existing one

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "gesturequiz-platform" or "webgues")
5. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Project to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Volumes/Data/webgues

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit: GestureQuiz platform ready for deployment"

# Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main"
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will automatically deploy your site
- This usually takes 5-10 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready
- Your site will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/quiz-app/`

## 🌐 Your Live URLs

Once deployed, your platform will be accessible at:

- **Main Platform**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/quiz-app/`
- **Teacher Dashboard**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/quiz-app/pages/teacher-dashboard.html`
- **Student Dashboard**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/quiz-app/pages/student-dashboard.html`
- **System Management**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/quiz-app/pages/system-command-center.html`

## 📱 Progressive Web App Features

Your deployed app will include:

## 🔄 Updating Your Live Site

To update your live website:

```bash
# Make your changes to the code
# Then commit and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Update: describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

Changes will be live within 5-10 minutes!

## 💾 Data Storage on GitHub Pages

Since GitHub Pages is static hosting:

- **User Data**: Stored in browser's localStorage
- **Persistent**: Data persists between sessions
- **Cross-Device**: Users can export/import data
- **Backup**: Built-in export features for data backup
- **Sync**: Real-time sync within same browser/device

## 🎯 Sharing Your Platform

Once live, share these links:

### For Teachers:
- Direct link: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/quiz-app/`
- QR Code: Generate QR code for easy mobile access
- Instructions: "Visit the link, click 'Get Started', and register as a teacher"

### For Students:
- Same link as above
- Instructions: "Visit the link, click 'Get Started', and register as a student"
- Teachers can share their class codes for easy enrollment

## 🔐 Free Forever Features

Your GitHub Pages deployment includes:

- ✅ **Unlimited Users**: No user limits

- ✅ **Unlimited Classes**: Manage unlimited classes
- ✅ **Full Analytics**: Complete reporting and analytics

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that your repository is **Public**
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Wait 10-15 minutes for initial deployment
4. Check GitHub Actions tab for any error messages

### If site doesn't load:
1. Make sure the URL includes `/quiz-app/` at the end
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Try accessing in incognito/private browsing mode

### For data issues:
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Visit the "Setup Test Data" page to generate sample data
3. Use the export/import features to backup/restore data
