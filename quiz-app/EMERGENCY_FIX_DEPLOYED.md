## üîç PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### The Issue
- **White Page:** Live site was showing completely white page with no content
- **No Error Messages:** Users saw blank screen instead of the landing page
- **Complete Site Failure:** Platform was inaccessible to all users

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **Firebase JavaScript loading conflicts** in the original `index.html`:

1. **Firebase Bundle Conflict:** Using `firebase.js` bundle instead of individual modules
2. **Script Loading Order:** Configuration scripts loading before Firebase was ready
3. **JavaScript Errors:** Critical errors preventing page rendering
4. **Missing Error Handling:** No fallback when Firebase failed to initialize
