# Grade Validation Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem Resolved
The error "An invalid form control with name='grade' is not focusable" has been permanently fixed.

## Root Cause
The grade field had the `required` attribute in the HTML but was hidden when teachers selected their role. The browser tried to validate the required field but couldn't focus on it because it was hidden, causing the validation error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Initial State Management
- **Before**: Grade field had `required` attribute in HTML
- **After**: Grade field starts WITHOUT `required` attribute
- **JavaScript**: Explicitly removes `required` on page load

```javascript
// Initialize form state - remove required from grade field initially
const gradeSelect = document.getElementById('grade');
gradeSelect.removeAttribute('required');
updateDebug('Removed required attribute from grade field initially');
```

### 2. Dynamic Requirement Management
- **Student selected**: Adds `required` attribute to grade field
- **Teacher selected**: Removes `required` attribute from grade field
- **Field visibility**: Properly synchronized with requirement status

### 3. Browser Validation Prevention
- Form has `novalidate` attribute
- Submit button is `type="button"` (not submit)
- Manual JavaScript validation handling

## Files Modified
- `/quiz-app/register.html` - Fixed grade field initialization and management

## Technical Details
