# 🚫 REDIRECT ISSUE COMPLETELY FIXED

## ✅ Problem Solved!

**Issue**: Website `https://ahmadadeltub.github.io/gesturequiz-platform` was automatically redirecting to login page
**Root Cause**: Meta refresh tag in HTML head causing immediate redirect
**Status**: **COMPLETELY FIXED** ✅

## 🔍 What Was Causing the Redirect

There were **TWO** automatic redirects happening:

### 1. **Meta Refresh Tag (Main Culprit)**
```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=quiz-app/">
```
- This was causing **immediate redirect** (0 seconds) to the quiz-app folder
- Located in the HTML `<head>` section
- **STATUS**: ✅ **REMOVED**

### 2. **JavaScript setTimeout (Secondary)**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = 'quiz-app/';
}, 2000);
```
- This was causing redirect after 2 seconds
- **STATUS**: ✅ **REMOVED**

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: Removed Meta Refresh**
- ❌ Removed: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=quiz-app/">`
- ✅ Result: No immediate redirect on page load

### **Fix 2: Removed JavaScript Timeout**
- ❌ Removed: `setTimeout(() => { window.location.href = 'quiz-app/'; }, 2000);`
- ✅ Result: No timed redirect after 2 seconds

## 🌐 Current Behavior
