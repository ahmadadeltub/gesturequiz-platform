# 🎉 PROFILE ICON PERSISTENCE ISSUE - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**
**Problem**: Profile icon changes were not being saved and would reset to default after page refresh.

**Root Cause**: Firebase configuration mismatch between different files - some were using the old project `gesturequiz-platform-429dd` while others used the new project `gesturequiz-platform-live`.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Firebase Configuration Updates**
- ✅ Updated `firebase-data-manager.js` to use correct project
- ✅ Updated `student-dashboard.html` Firebase config  
- ✅ Updated `teacher-dashboard.html` Firebase config
- ✅ All configs now point to `gesturequiz-platform-live`

### **2. Student Dashboard Enhancement**
- ✅ Added clickable avatar for profile editing
- ✅ Created profile modal with emoji selection
- ✅ Integrated with FirebaseDataManager for persistence
- ✅ Added fallback to localStorage for offline support

### **3. Profile Save/Load System**
- ✅ Profile changes now save to Firestore database
- ✅ Changes persist after page refresh
- ✅ Real-time UI updates when profile is changed
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Firebase Projects:**
- **OLD (broken)**: gesturequiz-platform-429dd
