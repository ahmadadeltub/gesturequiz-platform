# ✅ FIXED: Grade Field Validation Error

## 🐛 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The browser was showing multiple validation errors:
```
An invalid form control with name='grade' is not focusable.
```

This occurred because the grade select field was being validated by the browser even when it was hidden (when teacher role was selected).

## 🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Added Proper Form Structure**
- Wrapped form elements in `<form>` tag with `novalidate` attribute
- Added proper `name` attributes to all form fields
- Prevents browser auto-validation conflicts

### 2. **Dynamic Required Attribute Management**
- Grade field `required` attribute is now managed dynamically
- **Student selected** → Grade field gets `required="required"`
- **Teacher selected** → Grade field `required` attribute is removed

### 3. **Enhanced Field Management**
```javascript
if (selectedRole === 'teacher') {
    teacherFields.classList.add('show');
    studentFields.classList.remove('show');
    // Remove required from grade when teacher selected
    gradeSelect.removeAttribute('required');
} else {
    teacherFields.classList.remove('show');
    studentFields.classList.add('show');
    // Add required to grade when student selected
    gradeSelect.setAttribute('required', 'required');
}
```

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

1. **Form Element Structure**:
   - Added `<form id="registrationForm" novalidate>`
   - Added `name` attributes to all input fields
   - Proper form closing tag

2. **Dynamic Validation**:
   - Grade field `required` attribute managed by role selection
   - Hidden fields no longer cause validation errors
   - Manual validation handling in JavaScript

3. **Field Names Added**:
   - `name="fullName"`
   - `name="email"`
   - `name="password"`
   - `name="confirmPassword"`
   - `name="grade"`
   - `name="school"`
   - `name="department"`
   - `name="teacherBio"`
   - `name="studentSchool"`
   - `name="interests"`
