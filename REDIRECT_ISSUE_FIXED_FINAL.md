# ✅ REDIRECT ISSUE FIXED - WEBSITE NOW STABLE

## Issue Description
The website was automatically redirecting authenticated users to the student dashboard, making it behave unprofessionally instead of like a normal landing page.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Conflicting Firebase Auth Scripts**: The `quiz-app/index.html` was loading `firebase-auth.js` which contained automatic redirect logic for authenticated users.
2. **Firebase Hosting Rewrites**: The hosting configuration was redirecting all routes to `/index.html` instead of handling sub-routes properly.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Removed Conflicting Auth Script
- **File**: `/quiz-app/index.html`
- **Action**: Removed `firebase-auth.js` script that was causing automatic redirects
- **Before**: Landing page would redirect authenticated users to dashboard
- **After**: Landing page stays stable regardless of authentication status

### 2. Fixed Firebase Hosting Configuration
- **File**: `firebase.json`
- **Action**: Added proper route handling for `/quiz-app/**` paths
- **Before**: All routes redirected to root index.html
- **After**: Quiz-app routes properly load quiz-app/index.html

### 3. Maintained Override Logic
- **File**: `/quiz-app/index.html`
- **Action**: Kept the FirebaseDataManager override that prevents auto-redirects
- **Result**: Even authenticated users stay on landing page until manually clicking buttons

## Current Behavior

### Main Website (/)
- ✅ Professional landing page with no redirects
- ✅ No Firebase authentication logic
- ✅ Clean, modern design with proper navigation
- ✅ Works for all users (authenticated or not)

### Quiz App Landing (/quiz-app/)
- ✅ Stable landing page with authentication options

- ✅ Professional behavior like a real SaaS platform

## Verification
1. **Main URL**: https://gesturequiz-platform-live.web.app - ✅ No redirects
2. **Quiz App**: https://gesturequiz-platform-live.web.app/quiz-app/ - ✅ No redirects
3. **Authenticated Users**: Stay on landing pages until manual navigation
4. **Professional Behavior**: Works like a real business website

## Files Modified
- `/quiz-app/index.html` - Removed firebase-auth.js script

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
